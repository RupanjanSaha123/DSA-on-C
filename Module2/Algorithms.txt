Push Operation
Push operation used to insert an element into the stack.

Algorithm:
STEP1: START
STEP2: IF TOP = MAX-1
                PRINT 'OVERFLOW'
                go to step5
STEP3: SET TOP = TOP+1
STEP4: SET STACK [TOP] = VALUE
STEP5: END

Pop Operation
The pop operation is used to delete the top most element from the stack.

Algorithm:
STEP1: START
STEP2: IF TOP = NULL
                PRINT 'UNDERFLOW'
                go to STEP5
STEP3: SET VAL= STACK[TOP]
STEP4: SET TOP = TOP-1
STEP5: END

Peek Operation
Peek operation is the operation which returns the top most value of the stack without deleting it from the stack.

Algorithm:
STEP1: START
STEP2: IF TOP = NULL
                PRINT 'STACK IS EMPTY'
                go to STEP4
STEP3: RETURN STACK[TOP]
STEP4: END

OPERATIONS ON A LINKED STACK

Push Operation
The push operation is used to insert an element into the stack

STEP1: START
STEP2: Allocate memory for the new
        node and name it as NEW_NODE
STEP3:  SET NEW_NODE -> DATA = VAL
STEP4: IF TOP = NULL
        SET NEW_NODE NEXT = NULL
        SET TOP = NEW_NODE
Step5: END    

APPLICATIONS OF STACKS

In this section we will discuss typical problems where stacks can be easily applied for a simple
and efficient solution. The topics that will be discussed in this section include the following:

∑ Reversing a list
∑ Parentheses checker
∑ Conversion of an infix expression into a postfix expression
∑ Evaluation of a postfix expression
∑ Conversion of an infix expression into a prefix expression
∑ Evaluation of a prefix expression
∑ Recursion
∑ Tower of Hanoi


Convert the following infix expressions into postfix expressions.

 1.(A–B) * (C+D)
[AB–] * [CD+]
AB–CD+*

2.(A + B) / (C + D) – (D * E)
[AB+] / [CD+] – [DE*]
[AB+CD+/] – [DE*]
AB+CD+/DE*–

Convert the following infix expressions into prefix expressions.
Solution

(a) (A + B) * C
(+AB)*C
*+ABC

(b) (A–B) * (C+D)
[–AB] * [+CD]
*–AB+CD

(c) (A + B) / ( C + D) – ( D * E)
[+AB] / [+CD] – [*DE]
[/+AB+CD] – [*DE]
–/+AB+CD*DE
