1. Basic Terminologies
Data Structure: A way to organize data so it can be used efficiently.
Linear DS: Elements are sequential (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues).
Non-Linear DS: Elements are hierarchical (e.g., Trees, Graphs).
Data Hierarchy: Bit $\to$ Byte $\to$ Field $\to$ Record $\to$ File.

2. Algorithm Analysis (The "Big 3" Notations)
Time Complexity: How "fast" it runs as input grows.
Space Complexity: How much "memory" it needs.
Time-Space Trade-off: Usually, to make an algorithm faster (Time $\downarrow$),
                     you have to use more memory (Space $\uparrow$).

                     
Notation    Symbol        Meaning                        Use Case
Big O        O(n)   Worst Case (Upper Bound)    Max time it could take. (Most important).
Omega        Ω(n)   Best Case (Lower Bound)     Min time it will take.
Theta        Θ(n)  Average Case (Tight Bound)   The average performance.

3. Array Operations (The Logic Rules)
Traversal: Visiting every element once. Loop from 0 to n-1.

Insertion (Add Item):
1.Start loop at the END (n-1).

2.Move backwards to pos.

3.Shift elements RIGHT (arr[i+1] = arr[i]).

4.Update size: n++.

Deletion (Remove Item):
1.Start loop at POS.

2.Move forwards to end.

3.Shift elements LEFT (arr[i] = arr[i+1]).

4.Update size: n--.

Feature             Linear Search                     Binary Search
Prerequisite    None (Works on unsorted data)     MUST be Sorted
Method          Check one by one (Sequential)     Divide & Conquer (Split in half)
Time Complexity O(n) (Slow for large data)        O(logn) (Very Fast)
Logic           Loop i from 0 to n                mid = (low + high) / 2

5. "Teacher's Tips" for C Coding
Index starts at 0: The 5th element is at index 4.

Integer Division: In C, (0 + 9) / 2 is 4, not 4.5. This matters for calculating mid in Binary Search.

Modifying Size: If a function changes the array size (Insertion/Deletion), pass the size as a pointer (int *n),
 otherwise the change won't be saved outside the function.
