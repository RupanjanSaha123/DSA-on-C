1. Algorithm for Traversal

Goal: Visit and print every element in the array.
Step 1: Start.
Step 2: Initialize an index variable i = 0.
Step 3: Check if i is less than the total number of elements N.
Step 4: If True:
Access/Print the element Arr[i].
Increment i by 1 (i = i + 1).
Go back to Step 3.
Step 5: If False (end of array reached), Stop.

2. Algorithm for Insertion

Goal: Add a value VAL at a specific index POS.
Step 1: Start.
Step 2: Check if the array is already full (Overflow). If yes, print error and Stop.
Step 3: Initialize a loop counter i pointing to the last element (N - 1).
Step 4: Repeat while i >= POS:
Move the current element to the next position: Arr[i + 1] = Arr[i].
Decrement i by 1.
Step 5: Insert the new value at the correct spot: Arr[POS] = VAL.
Step 6: Increment the total size N = N + 1.
Step 7: Stop.

3. Algorithm for Deletion

Goal: Remove a value from a specific index POS.
Step 1: Start.
Step 2: Check if the array is empty (Underflow). If yes, print error and Stop.
Step 3: Initialize a loop counter i at the deletion position POS.
Step 4: Repeat while i < N - 1 (until the second to last element):
Copy the next element into the current position: Arr[i] = Arr[i + 1].
Increment i by 1.
Step 5: Decrement the total size N = N - 1.
Step 6: Stop.

4. Algorithm for Linear Search

Goal: Find KEY in an unsorted array.
Step 1: Start.
Step 2: Initialize index i = 0.
Step 3: Repeat while i < N:
Check if Arr[i] == KEY.
If True: Print "Found at index i" and Go to Step 5 (Success).
If False: Increment i (i = i + 1).
Step 4: If loop finishes and KEY was not found, print "Not Found".
Step 5: Stop

5. Algorithm for Binary Search

Goal: Find KEY in a SORTED array using Divide and Conquer.
Step 1: Start.
Step 2: Set Low = 0 and High = N - 1.
Step 3: Repeat while Low <= High:
Calculate Middle: Mid = (Low + High) / 2 (Integer division).
Case A: If Arr[Mid] == KEY, return Mid (Success). Stop.
Case B: If Arr[Mid] < KEY, the key is in the right half. Set Low = Mid + 1.
Case C: If Arr[Mid] > KEY, the key is in the left half. Set High = Mid - 1.
Step 4: If loop ends without finding KEY, return "Not Found".
Step 5: Stop.
